Technical Interview Introduction:
Good [morning/afternoon], I’m Reddy Venkat Kalyan, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Science
 at KL University, with a CGPA of 9.49. I completed my Intermediate education at Larambha College and high school 
at The Kosala School, both in my hometown of Bargarh.

I was introduced to web development in my second year as part of academics and developed my skills as 
a full-stack developer. I work with technologies like React, Spring Boot, and Django. For frontend development,
 I typically use free templates, which I customize to suit the project's requirements. On the backend, I write most of 
the code myself and refer to resources like official documentation, ChatGPT, and past project code when needed.

I’ve worked on projects like Task Prompter, improving task management efficiency by 30%, and a 
Counseling Management System, which optimized student-counselor interactions by 40%. I’m also familiar with Git 
and GitHub for version control. Though I’m still learning cloud technologies like AWS, I’m confident in my ability 
to adapt and use available resources to build functional applications.”

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton and engage in activities like crypto mining. I believe my passion for 
continuous learning and practical problem-solving would make me a valuable addition to your team.”
