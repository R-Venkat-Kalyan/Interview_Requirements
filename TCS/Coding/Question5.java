// Problem Statement â€“
// Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose value is greater than all of its prior elements.
// Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.

// For example,
// Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}
// As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.
// 8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.
// Since total of  3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.
// Hence the output = 3.
