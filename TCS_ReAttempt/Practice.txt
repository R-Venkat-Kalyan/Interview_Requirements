Self Intro
------------
My name is Reddy Venkat Kalyan, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from KL University. 
I’ve recently completed my final semester examinations and am currently waiting for the results.

I’m a multilingual Full Stack Developer who can work with the Spring Boot framework for backend development. 
On the frontend, I use HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap to build clean and responsive user interfaces. 
For data storage, I work with both MySQL and MongoDB, depending on the project requirements.

I’ve built several web-based projects aimed at solving real-world problems faced by me or those around me. 
These include Task Prompter, a tool for scheduling tasks and sending reminders; a Counseling Management System to support
student and administrator interactions; and an Online Notes App to make academic materials easily accessible.

I use Git and GitHub to push and manage my code regularly, and I am familiar with basic version control operations. 
I believe that being able to work across different technologies, even with just foundational knowledge, is essential. 
I also rely on AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to support my learning and speed up development, as it's not practical for 
anyone to remember every detail.

During my final semester, I interned at Cognizant Technology Solutions in the Pega domain, 
where I contributed to the development of an Insurance Claim Management System. 
This application helped streamline the claims process within a financial platform using Pega's low-code tools.
The internship gave me an opportunity to understand how large-scale systems function in a corporate setting and showed 
me how collaboration with colleagues plays a key role in delivering effective solutions. It was a valuable experience that gave me
exposure to real-time development workflows.

Overall, I’m someone who likes building useful things, keeps learning through hands-on practice, and is eager to grow by
contributing to meaningful work in a collaborative environment.



Why Prime
---------------
TCS Prime offers an excellent opportunity for engineers to work on cutting-edge projects, emphasizing learning and leadership. 
It aligns with my drive to grow in a structured yet innovation-driven environment boosting my skills.

What Is Prime
--------------------
TCS prime is one of the jo roles offered to candidates based on their score in NQT recruitment test.
TCS usually used to hire for two roles namely known as Ninja & Digital and in the recent years it included this prime role
which provides the opportuinity for graduates to work on cutting edge technologies.


Java vs Pthon vs C
--------------------
Java 
	compiled programming language 
	automatic garbage collection 
	source code compiled to bytecode and run by JVM

Python
	interpreted language 
	uses reference counting with cyclic garbage collection
	source code is interpreted by python interpreter

C
	procedural language
	no automatic garbage collection
	source code is directly compiled to machine code
	



OOP Concepts with Project Examples
----------------------------------------------------
Encapsulation:
In my Task Prompter project, each task was represented by a Task class with private fields like title, dueDate, and 
public getters/setters to access them.

Inheritance:
In my Spring Boot projects, I created a BaseEntity class with common fields like id, createdAt, which were extended by multiple 
entity classes like User, Task, etc.

Polymorphism:
In my Counseling System, I used interfaces like UserService with multiple implementations (for students and admins), allowing
flexible service logic.

Abstraction:
In all backend APIs, I exposed only required endpoints to the frontend while hiding the business logic inside service classes.


Handling Exceptions in Java
---------------------------------------
I use try-catch blocks to handle specific exceptions like NullPointerException, IOException, etc.
For REST APIs, I implement global exception handling using
@ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler to return proper HTTP status and messages.


When to choose MongoDB over MySQL
-------------------------------------------------------
Choose MongoDB when:
You need to store unstructured or flexible data (e.g., JSON-like documents).
Schema may evolve frequently (no fixed schema).
You require faster development with nested or hierarchical data.
You're building real-time apps like chat systems, content management, or IoT apps.


Indexing in MongoDB and Capped Collections
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Indexing in MongoDB improves query performance by allowing faster data retrieval.
The default _id index is created automatically.
You can add indexes on fields using db.collection.createIndex({ field: 1 }).
Use indexes on frequently queried or sorted fields to avoid full collection scans.

Capped Collections are fixed-size collections that overwrite oldest documents when full.
Best used for logging, caching, or sensor data where recent entries matter.
They preserve insertion order and have fast writes.



												int vs Integer
												--------------

int
---
Type: Primitive data type
Size: 4 bytes (32 bits)
Default value: 0
Stored in: Stack (for local variables)
Usage: Used for fast, low-level operations.


Integer
-------
Type: Wrapper Class (part of java.lang)
Object type: Yes
Default value: null (when used in objects or collections)
Stored in: Heap (since it's an object)
Usage: Used when you need an object (e.g., for collections like ArrayList)



										Compile Time vs Run Time
										------------------------
Compile Time
------------
It happens during the compilation before execution.
Main goal is to translate source code to byte code.
Common compilation errors are missing semicolon, invalid data type, missing imports, etc.
Output Compiled file (e.g., .class file in Java)


Run Time
--------
It happens While the program is executing
Main goal is to run the logic written in the program
Common run time errors are Division by zero, null pointer exceptions, logic bugs
Output Program output or crash
